                  <strong>Milking The Moon: Becoming The Renewal</strong> is an upcoming live
                  performance of Bulgarian folk dances & songs as part of the 7th GORANA
                  International Dance festival.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ancient Bulgarian culture paved the way for the festivals and traditions that are
                  still alive in Bulgaria today. Life, health, love and joy are represented by
                  water, wheat, greenery, flowers and more in ritual dancing. In the spring, seeds
                  are planted in the ground to sustain the renewal of life. Rich in beauty,
                  cheerfulness, mysteries and fiery dances with beautiful costumes, Bulgarian
                  folklore must be seen, heard and experienced!
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are many Bulgarian holidays and traditions dedicated to the spring and
                  summer. A few of them are:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Lazarovden</strong> is celebrated on the Saturday before Easter. It is the
                  "coming of age" celebration for young girls known as "lazarki". The maidens are
                  dressed in colorful costumes with wreaths of flowers in their hair, and sing and
                  dance with handkerchieves as they go from home to home to cleanse the spaces.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Tsvetnitsa</strong> is "The Flower's Day". On the Sunday one week before
                  Easter, Bulgarians bring home twigs from willow trees and use them to decorate
                  gates, doors and windows as a sign of faith.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Velikden</strong> is Easter, the main holiday for all Orthodox Christians.
                  It is connected to the first full moon after the spring solstice day.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Saint George's Day</strong> is on May 6th. On this day, unmarried young
                  women are invited onto decorated swings, as it is believed that the swinging will
                  help them get married. Along with that, everyone with the name Georgi or Gergana
                  celebrates their name day.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Nestinarstvo</strong> is an ancient ritual where fire dancers known as
                  "nestinari" walk and dance on live embers. It originates from Thracian sun worship
                  asking the Sun God for health, prosperity and fertility in the new year.

                <h2>A note from Elissaveta</h2>
                <h4><i>Artistic Director, Producer & Choreographer</i></h4>

                <p>
                  Each performer in <strong>Milking The Moon: Becoming The Renewal</strong> holds a
                  passion, in his or her own way, for exploring the new meanings and relevance of
                  traditional practices in our contemporary world thousands of miles away from
                  Bulgaria.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On a professional level, we look for interdisciplinary links. On a personal level,
                  we see our engagement in Bulgarian folk art not only as vital sharing of our
                  artistic expression, but also as a way to connect our roots with our new home in
                  the US, helping young Bulgarian-Americans born here build a relationship with
                  their origins.

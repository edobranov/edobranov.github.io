                <h3>22. Lazarki / Velikden – Gorana Dance</h3>
                <p>
                  This dance is part of a ritual on Lazarus Day. Lazarus is a symbol of health and
                  longevity. Lazarus Day is celebrated on the eight day before Orthodox Easter
                  (Velikden) and is always on a Saturday. On this day, the "lazaruvane" custom is
                  performed by young girls called "lazarki". They go from house to house where they
                  dance, perform rituals, cleanse with their handkerchieves, and offer blessings for
                  health, happiness and prosperity. In the past, it was believed that girls who did
                  not partake in the custom would not get married. It was therefore necessary for
                  every girl in a village to partake in the custom at least once in her maidenhood.

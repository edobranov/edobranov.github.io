                Ancient Bulgarian culture paved the way for the festivals and traditions that are
                still alive in Bulgaria today. Life, health, love and joy are represented by water,
                wheat, greenery, flowers and more in ritual dancing. In the spring, seeds are
                planted in the ground to sustain the renewal of life. Rich in beauty, cheerfulness,
                mysteries and fiery dances with beautiful costumes, Bulgarian folklore must be seen,
                heard and experienced!
              </p>
              <p>
                There are many Bulgarian holidays and traditions dedicated to the spring and summer.
                A few of them are:
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Lazarovden</strong> is celebrated on the Saturday before Easter. It is the
                "coming of age" celebration for young girls known as "lazarki". The maidens are
                dressed in colorful costumes with wreaths of flowers in their hair, and sing and
                dance with handkerchieves as they go from home to home to cleanse the spaces.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Tsvetnitsa</strong> is "The Flower's Day". On the Sunday one week before
                Easter, Bulgarians bring home twigs from willow trees and use them to decorate
                gates, doors and windows as a sign of faith.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Velikden</strong> is Easter, the main holiday for all Orthodox Christians.
                It is connected to the first full moon after the spring solstice day.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Saint George's Day</strong> is on May 6th. On this day, unmarried young
                women are invited onto decorated swings, as it is believed that the swinging will
                help them get married. Along with that, everyone with the name Georgi or Gergana
                celebrates their name day.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Nestinarstvo</strong> is an ancient ritual where fire dancers known as
                "nestinari" walk and dance on live embers. It originates from Thracian sun worship
                asking the Sun God for health, prosperity and fertility in the new year.

                <h3>22. Lazarki / Velikden – Gorana Dance</h3>
                <p>
                  This dance is part of a ritual on Lazarus Day. Lazarus is a symbol of health and
                  longevity. Lazarus Day is celebrated on the eight day before Orthodox Easter
                  (Velikden) and is always on a Saturday. On this day, the "lazaruvane" custom is
                  performed by young girls called "lazarki". They go from house to house where they
                  dance, perform rituals, cleanse with their handkerchieves, and offer blessings for
                  health, happiness and prosperity. In the past, it was believed that girls who did
                  not partake in the custom would not get married. It was therefore necessary for
                  every girl in a village to partake in the custom at least once in her maidenhood.
